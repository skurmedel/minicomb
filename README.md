A small set of helpers for working with elementary combinatorics, mostly geared toward studying combinatorics.

If you are desktop/laptop bound and can, you should use the excellent Sympy facilities instead. 

This library is mostly for learning, and platforms such as calculators where we do not have access to Sympy.
